                <strong>North Las Vegas</strong> has undergone a remarkable
                transformation over the past decade. What was once considered a
                distant suburb is now a thriving city with new master-planned
                communities, major employers, and infrastructure improvements
                that make it an inventory band to compare at Suite 100.{" "}
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> compares $385K
                median listings, named campuses, and commute minutes on this
                north clock.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a median home price of <strong>$385,000</strong>—roughly
                $65,000 less than Las Vegas and $100,000 less than
                Henderson—North Las Vegas listings at that band are compared by
                square footage and commute, not a caption. Buyers priced out of
                Summerlin $625K or Henderson $485K January 2026 medians can walk
                North Las Vegas product at $385K. And with Nevada's lack of
                state income tax, more of a paycheck can go toward the PITI
                line.

                </strong>{" "}
                provides the same expert service in North Las Vegas as we do in
                the valley's luxury markets. Dr. Jan Duffy helps compare square
                footage, named campuses, and financing files on this north
                clock. For new construction—where builders' sales agents
                represent the builder, not you—BHHS provides free buyer
                representation that can save thousands in upgrades and
                negotiations.

                The current market shows <strong>892 active listings</strong>{" "}
                with homes averaging
                <strong> 32 days on market</strong>—slightly longer than the
                valley average, giving buyers more time to make informed
                decisions. Year-over-year appreciation of <strong>3.2%</strong>
                is more modest than luxury markets but represents solid,
                sustainable growth. Investors find particularly strong
                opportunities here, with rental yields often exceeding 6%.

                Working with <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> in
                North Las Vegas means getting honest guidance about which
                neighborhoods offer the best value, which builders have the best
                reputations, and which areas are poised for the strongest
                appreciation. Dr. Jan Duffy won't push you toward a more
                expensive area when North Las Vegas fits your needs—that
                integrity is what sets BHHS apart from agencies focused solely
                on commission.
