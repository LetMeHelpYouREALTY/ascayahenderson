              <p>
                Developed by The Howard Hughes Corporation since 1990, Summerlin
                spans 22,500 acres along the western rim of the Las Vegas
                Valley. Red Rock Canyon trailheads sit on the same west clock as
                the villages — hiking and bike paths minutes from listing
                streets. With over 150 parks, 150 miles of trails, and nine golf
                courses, we compare acreage and drive time from Suite 100, not a
                slogan.

                square footage and Red Rock Country Club custom lots are
