                <strong>Henderson</strong> is Nevada's second-largest city with
                over 320,000 residents. Compare streets by square footage, HOA
                dues, parks, and commute minutes from 9406 W Lake Mead Blvd—not
                by slogan. <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> has
                been helping buyers find Henderson homes for decades, and Dr.
                Jan Duffy brings unmatched expertise to every transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                What sets Henderson apart is scale and planning: 60+ parks,
                recreation centers, and master-planned villages 15–25 minutes
                from the Strip. Nevada has no state income tax, which is why
                many California buyers compare Henderson floor plans and HOA
                amenities before they list a West Coast home.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Henderson real estate market offers remarkable diversity.
                From the tree-lined streets of <strong>Green Valley</strong> to
                the town-center amenities of <strong>Inspirada</strong>, from
                the luxury estates of <strong>MacDonald Highlands</strong> to
                the waterfront properties at
                <strong> Lake Las Vegas</strong>—Green Valley, Inspirada,
                MacDonald Highlands, and the 320-acre lake are compared by
                square footage, HOA packet, and drive time from Suite 100.

                Choosing <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> for
                your Henderson home search means working with agents who
                understand the subtle differences between Henderson's many

                campuses such as Coronado High School and Green Valley High
                School, review HOA documents, and compare recent sales. That
                local knowledge, backed by the resources and reputation of
                Berkshire Hathaway, makes all the difference.
