                <strong>The Ridges</strong> sits in Summerlin along the
                foothills of Red Rock Canyon: 900 homesites across 793 acres, a
                staffed gate, and ridge-top lots with Strip, mountain, and
                desert views. When buyers compare ridge-top lots to Downtown
                Summerlin retail, they start with{" "}
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> so gate lists
                and showing windows are confirmed from Suite 100.

                Six villages—Bear&apos;s Best, Falcon Ridge, Azure, Talon Ridge,
                Silver Ridge, and Eagle Hills—share architectural guidelines.
                Square footage, lot elevation, and golf-club access vary by
                village. Compare those numbers at 9406 W Lake Mead Blvd, Suite
                100 instead of a slogan. Photography and access are scheduled,
                not improvised.

                  Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties
                </strong>{" "}
                has represented buyers and sellers in The Ridges since the
                community's inception. Dr. Jan Duffy understands that luxury
                transactions require gate lists, photography scoped in writing,
                and addresses kept off group texts. The BHHS referral desk
                connects Ridges appointments from 9406 W Lake Mead Blvd, Suite
                100 — typically 15–20 minutes to the guardhouse.

                The current Ridges market shows{" "}
                <strong>42 active listings</strong> with homes averaging
                <strong> 67 days on market</strong>—longer than the valley
                average, reflecting the careful consideration luxury buyers give
                to properties at this level. The median price of
                <strong> $2.5 million</strong> represents exceptional value
                compared to comparable communities in California or Hawaii.
                Properties range from $1.5 million to over $15 million for the
                most spectacular custom estates.

                Working with <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> in
                The Ridges means working with agents who schedule gate lists,
                photography, and off-market windows from Suite 100. Dr. Jan
                Duffy coordinates access with architects, designers, and
                property managers when the brief includes those vendors. When
                the list price is measured in millions, the Berkshire Hathaway
                name is on the paperwork at 9406 W Lake Mead Blvd.
