                <strong>Skye Canyon</strong> represents the future of Las Vegas
                master-planned living. This 1,700-acre community in northwest
                Las Vegas sits next to Floyd Lamb Park with Skye Center as the
                rec campus. <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong>
                registers you at Suite 100 before the first model row so builder
                tours stay on one northwest clock.
              </p>
              <p>
                What sets Skye Canyon apart is Skye Center—a stunning 15-acre
                amenity complex that rivals resort facilities. The facility
                features multiple pools including a zero-entry resort pool and
                lap pool, a state-of-the-art fitness center, tennis and
                pickleball courts, and flexible event spaces that host community
                gatherings throughout the year. From summer movie nights to
                holiday celebrations, Skye Center creates the kind of community
                connections that transform neighborhoods into true communities.

                offers free buyer representation on all Skye Canyon new
                construction purchases. This is crucial because when you walk
                into a builder's sales center, those agents work for the
                builder—not you. Dr. Jan Duffy represents your interests,
                negotiates upgrades, reviews contracts for hidden pitfalls, and
                ensures you're getting fair value. This service costs buyers
                nothing—builders pay the commission.
