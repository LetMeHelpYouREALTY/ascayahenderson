                <strong>Mountains Edge</strong> delivers what many Las Vegas
                buyers are seeking: master-planned community amenities at prices
                significantly below Summerlin or Henderson. This 3,500-acre
                community in southwest Las Vegas offers mountain views,
                exceptional parks, and modern homes—without the premium prices
                of Summerlin or The Ridges.{" "}
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong>
                helps value-conscious buyers discover Mountains Edge's
                potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                The community's crown jewel is Exploration Peak Park—120 acres
                of open space that stands as the Las Vegas Valley's largest
                park. From the park's summit, residents enjoy panoramic views of
                the Las Vegas Strip, surrounding mountains, and the desert floor
                stretching to the horizon. It's a daily reminder that Mountains
                Edge offers something special: the combination of suburban
                convenience with genuine connection to Southern Nevada's natural
                beauty.

                  Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties
                </strong>{" "}
                serves Mountains Edge buyers with the same commitment to
                excellence we bring to the valley's luxury markets. Dr. Jan
                Duffy understands that value doesn't mean compromise—it means
                finding the right home at the right price. For buyers priced out
                of Summerlin or Henderson, Mountains Edge is compared by square
                footage, HOA dues, and minutes from Suite 100 — not as a swapped
                Summerlin caption.
