                <strong>Centennial Hills</strong> represents mature northwest
                Las Vegas living. While newer communities like Skye Canyon
                attract attention, Centennial Hills offers something they can't:
                mature street trees, named campuses such as Arbor View High
                School, and landscaping that has had nearly two decades to grow.
                <strong> Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> helps buyers
                discover why Centennial Hills remains a frequently compared
                northwest Las Vegas address.
              </p>
              <p>
                The community's appeal starts with location. Positioned at the
                base of the mountains with easy access to US-95, Centennial
                Hills provides quick commutes throughout the valley while
                maintaining a distinctly suburban atmosphere. The mountains are
                visible from most streets, creating the feeling of living closer
                to nature than Centennial Hills' urban conveniences would
                suggest.
              </p>

                <strong>
                  Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties
                </strong>{" "}
                has represented Centennial Hills buyers and sellers since the
                community's earliest phases. Dr. Jan Duffy knows which streets
                offer the strongest mountain views, commute times to the Strip
                and Downtown Summerlin, and which HOAs publish current reserve
                studies. This local knowledge, combined with the BHHS commitment
                to client service, ensures Centennial Hills buyers and sellers
                receive exceptional representation.

                Working with <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> in
                Centennial Hills means partnering with agents who understand the
                community's evolution and can identify properties that represent
                genuine value. Dr. Jan Duffy helps buyers look beyond surface
                features to evaluate factors that matter long-term: construction
                quality, lot positioning, HOA documents, and named school
                campuses. That expertise translates into better purchase
                decisions and stronger long-term investments.
