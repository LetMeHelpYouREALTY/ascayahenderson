                <strong>Southern Highlands</strong> stands as southwest Las
                Vegas's answer to Summerlin—a meticulously planned 2,200-acre
                community centered around an award-winning championship golf
                course. For buyers seeking luxury living with convenient access
                to the Strip, airport, and I-15 corridor,{" "}
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> considers
                Southern Highlands among Las Vegas's finest residential options.
              </p>
              <p>
                The community's crown jewel is the Southern Highlands Golf Club,
                featuring a stunning Robert Trent Jones Jr. designed course that
                winds through the community's terrain. The private club offers
                members world-class golf, elegant dining, and a social calendar
                that brings the community together. Even non-golfing residents
                benefit from the course's presence—golf course views command
                premium prices and the manicured greens enhance the entire
                community's aesthetic.
