                <strong>Green Valley</strong> was established in 1988 as
                Henderson&apos;s first large-scale plat with HOA streets, parks,
                and golf. Three decades later the comparison is canopy age and
                lot size vs newer Henderson rec campuses. Today,{" "}
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> sequences Green
                Valley tours from Suite 100: The District first, then
                golf-course HOAs and interior streets on a 25–35 minute I-215
                east clock.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes Green Valley unique is something that can't be
                replicated: time. Over three decades, the community has matured
                into a verdant oasis with towering trees, HOA-maintained
                landscaping, and parks. While newer villages offer newer amenity
                campuses, Green Valley offers named campuses such as Green
                Valley High School, 35-year-old street trees, and HOA amenities
                that have been operating since the late 1980s.

                agents have been selling homes in Green Valley since the
                beginning. Dr. Jan Duffy knows which streets offer the strongest
                mountain views, named campuses such as Green Valley High School,
                and which HOAs publish current reserve studies. This local
                knowledge, combined with the resources and reputation of BHHS,
                gives Green Valley buyers and sellers a distinct advantage.
